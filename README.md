# Fuzzy memory

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/GyN50lHdJbLG0/giphy.gif" width="100%">

Assignment in Javascript course at Yrgo. We were supposed to create our very own memory game and we were given a free choice regarding the design, I was inspired by my favorite disney movies!

__The assignment had to consist of:__
* A memory game
* At least 8 pairs and a maximum of 10 pairs
* The pairs should be randomly positioned before a new game starts
* There should be a replay button to restart the game when finished
* The project can't contain any errors, warning or notices in the developer console

### Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScrip

__We were not allowed to use any other language or framework for this assignment.__

## Features
* One-player or two-player mode
* Choose between two decks
* Three different game levels
* Keep track of your gameplay stats while playing

## Responsive Design and compatibility
As for now the design is only made for desktop.

In the future I'll add media queries and maybe add even more features.
